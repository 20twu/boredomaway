HAHA, I'm bored, so i'm writing a speech here. Cause I have nothing better to do.

Everything the "insert club name" does, we believe in making the world a happier place, even if it's only a little.
How we build the happiness is by listening to people's problems, support anyone in difficult times, and to ensure that people feel okay and comfortable to ask for help.
We will be helping anyone in need, no matter if it's with the death of a pet or a math quesiton.
And even if we can't solve your problems in an instant (especially your hw questions) but we will be there to struggle through every step with you.
Anyone who wishes to "somehow connect to belief" should come to an interest meeting "insert time"

Still not there yet, so another speech. HAHA, your welcome.

Honorable Chairs, Fellow Delegates, and Distinguished Guests and Admin Staff

The whole delegation of Argentina is honored to be in your company today. We truly believe that everyone is here to grown and learn.
So don't be afraid to ask anyone from the Argentinian delegation for help. And the delegate would also ask of you to extend a helping hand to
all the people not just within MUN, but outside too by creating well-thought out resolutions to remind all the actual UN grownups that we can
help too! Thank you.
